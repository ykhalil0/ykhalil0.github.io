# Website Philosophy

Last updated: February 8, 2026.

This site should stay minimal, fast, and content-first, inspired by `https://karpathy.ai/`.

## Quick Guardrails
- Keep design simple and scannable; avoid visual noise.
- Use `Inter`.
- Preserve neutral palette (white + near-black text, blue links).
- Publication year accent uses Lebanese cedar green: `#00a651`.
- Keep single-column layout and generous whitespace.
- Keep social icons compact and header plain.

## Typography
- Desktop body: `16px / 1.58`.
- Mobile body: `15.5px / 1.56`.
- Section labels: `16px` desktop, `15px` mobile.
- Prioritize readability over density.

## Timeline Rules
- Keep a consistent logo box and alignment across rows.
- Avoid oversized logos and tiny blurry marks.
- Preserve clear `date -> logo -> description` scan order.

## Publication Rules
- Sort publications newest to oldest.
- Use title-first layout with year on the right in cedar green.
- Use IEEE-style metadata on the second line (no numeric indices).
- Keep DOI clickable and include PubMed when available.
- Keep punctuation and abbreviations consistent.

## Books Rules
- Keep `/books/` extremely simple and text-first.
- Group entries under lowercase sub-header categories (for example: `science fiction`, `history`).
- Use format: `Title — Author, Year.`
- Use year ranges for multi-volume works when needed (`1935-1975`).
- Personal comments/opinions are optional.
- If a personal comment is present, put it on the next line in muted text.
- Not every book entry needs a comment.

## Content Rules
- Keep copy concise and direct.
- Avoid placeholders and dead links.
- Keep core sections: `timeline`, `bio`, `projects`, `publications`, `book list`, `interests`.
- Keep `book list` on the homepage as a simple link to `/books/`.

## Pre-Push Checklist
1. Still minimal and content-first?
2. Typography and spacing still consistent?
3. Timeline logos still aligned and balanced?
4. Publications still follow title + year + IEEE-style metadata?
5. Looks right on desktop, iPad, and mobile (no overflow)?
6. Personal branding stays primary (`YK` favicon)?

# Website Philosophy

Last updated: February 8, 2026.

This site follows a "minimal style, rich substance" direction inspired by `https://karpathy.ai/`.

## North Star
- Content first.
- Clean, minimal visual language.
- Fast static site (`HTML` + `CSS`) with no unnecessary complexity.
- Professional, direct tone.

## Current UI/UX Preferences
- Typography:
  - Use `Inter`.
  - Keep body text readable (currently `16px`).
  - Keep headings simple and strong; section labels subtle but legible.
- Layout:
  - Single-column centered layout with generous whitespace.
  - Keep scanability high with clear section separation and simple hierarchy.
- Color:
  - Neutral background and text (white + dark gray/black).
  - Blue links; no loud palette shifts.
- Timeline:
  - Use recognizable brand logos/marks for entries.
  - Keep logos aligned and constrained so rows remain clean.
  - Avoid oversized logos and avoid tiny low-quality favicon-only look.
- Header/social:
  - Keep social icons simple and compact.
  - Keep tagline short and plain.

## Content Preferences
- Keep copy concise; avoid fluff.
- No placeholder links like `href="#"`.
- If a section has no real content yet, keep it minimal or hide it.
- Current important sections:
  - `timeline`
  - `bio`
  - `projects`
  - `publications`
  - `interests`

## Citation Standard
- Publication entries should use `IEEE` style (numbered, compact, scan-friendly).
- Base format:
  - `[n] Initials. Surname, Initials. Surname, and Initials. Surname, "Title," Journal Abbrev., vol. x, no. y, pp. z-z, Year, doi: DOI.`
- Keep the title linked to the publication page when available.
- Keep the DOI inline as part of the citation and make it clickable.
- Add a `PubMed` link at the end when available.
- Keep punctuation and spacing consistent across all entries.

## Responsiveness Standards
- Must look good on desktop, iPad, and mobile.
- Prevent horizontal overflow.
- Keep spacing and typography readable at smaller widths.
- Maintain clear timeline alignment across breakpoints.

## Brand Rules
- Favicon should be personal/neutral (`YK`) and not institution-branded.
- Do not let school/company branding override personal site identity.

## Do/Don't
- Do preserve the minimal, professional look.
- Do improve readability before adding visual complexity.
- Do use consistent sizing/alignment for logos and icons.
- Don't introduce decorative effects unless they add clear value.
- Don't add framework/tooling overhead for simple static needs.

## Pre-Push Checklist
1. Does the page still feel minimal and content-first?
2. Are there any placeholder links or placeholder sections left?
3. Does it render well on desktop, iPad, and mobile?
4. Are logos/icons aligned and visually balanced?

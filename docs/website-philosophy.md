# Website Philosophy

This site should follow a "minimal style, rich substance" approach inspired by `https://karpathy.ai/`.

## Core Direction
- Content first. The writing and links matter more than visual effects.
- Minimal styling. Keep CSS simple, readable, and easy to maintain.
- Lightweight stack. Static HTML/CSS, fast load, no heavy framework by default.
- Personal and direct voice. Keep copy clear and specific.

## Visual Guidelines
- Single-column, readable layout with generous whitespace.
- Neutral colors and straightforward typography.
- Use icons and small visual elements only when they improve scanning.
- Avoid decorative complexity, crowded sections, and flashy animation.

## Content Guidelines
- Header: name, short one-line tagline, social links/icons.
- Timeline: concise entries that show progression over time.
- Sections: `bio`, `projects`, `interests` in plain language.
- Featured media (videos/talks/interviews) is welcome, but should stay organized and lightweight.

## Editing Rules
- Every UI/content change should preserve the minimal, content-first feel.
- Prefer simple HTML structure over complex nested components.
- If adding a new section, keep it skimmable and consistent with existing spacing/typography.
- Avoid adding visual effects unless they add clear informational value.

## Quick Litmus Test
Before shipping a change, ask:
1. Is the page still simple and fast?
2. Is the content easier to read and scan?
3. Did we avoid unnecessary styling or UI complexity?
